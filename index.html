								<h3>HomeRoom is flexible</h3>
									<p>Its strength lies in its versatility. You can use it to build or implement any kind of virtual classroom you want to. From flipped classrooms to knowledge societies; the possibilities are endless. Your classroom is <strong>your space</strong>, and we at Auom don't want to take that away from you. How you use it depends on your unique needs and constraints. Learning is a product of educational self-organization, and HomeRoom is an environment to facilitate exactly that.</p>
							
								<h4>HomeRoom is <strong>not</strong> a Learning Management System</h4>
								
									<p>An LMS tends to force its own pedagogy onto classrooms regardless of the needs of the student or the subject being taught. Quizzes, homeworks and exams are administered online instead of in-person, but it's essentially still the same old rigid classroom the British left us with 300 years ago. 21st century tools should be used in a 21st century way.</p>
